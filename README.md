This project, "Dunkin Donuts Simulation Analysis," aimed to optimize store operations and reduce customer wait times by modeling and evaluating the service process using JaamSim. We developed two simulation models: the status quo representing current operations and an improved model incorporating our proposed solution. The simulation was built using real-world data collected from a Dunkin Donuts location, modeling arrival times, processing times, and service flows for both drive-thru and in-store customers. Our simulation revealed that the primary bottleneck occurs at the drive-thru during morning rush hours. We recommended hiring a part-time drive-thru order taker to alleviate congestion, reduce queue lengths, and boost customer satisfaction. This targeted solution is cost-effective and expected to enhance throughput and overall performance. The full report, presentation, and all supporting code and dataset files are included in this repository.
